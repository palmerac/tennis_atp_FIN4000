# ATP Tennis Outcome Predictability using Machine Learning

This report applies machine learning methods to predict the outcomes of tennis matches with the goal of determining how predictable tennis matches are and subsequently, what factors have the largest impact on this predictability.  \n

This report was done for our Finance 4000 class, Advanced Topics in Finance at the University of Guelph and completed by Aaron Palmer, Aidan Reeve, and Brody Galloway.  \n

The data was obtained/forked from https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp.
